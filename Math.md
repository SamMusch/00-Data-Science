1. **Prior**: Some underlying distribution
2. $\theta$ = uncertainty parameter
3. **Posterior**: Modified distribution



Quality of our variables

1. **Noninformative priors**:
2. **Informative priors**:
3. **Moderately informative priors**:

### Counting

**Sum Rule**: 

1. Possible outcomes come from 2 groups (*m* and *n*).
2. There are no overlaps.
3. Possible outcomes = *m* + *n*

**Product Rule**

1. Experiment has 2 parts.
2. 1st part results in *m* outcomes.
3. 2nd part results in *n* outcomes independently.
4. Possible outcomes = *m* * *n*

**The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**

1. Outcome can come from set A or set B.
2. The 2 sets might overlap.
3. Possible outcomes = A + B - (A and B)

**The Pigeonhole Principle**

1. *m* = set of objects
2. *n* = buckets
3. If there are more objects than buckets, at least one buckets gotta have more than 1 object.

### Combinatorics

**Permute**: process of arrangement

1. Start with *n* objects.
2. They can be arranged in n! ways.
3. Possible outcomes = $n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2)...$

**Combinations**

1. Start with *n* distinct possible objects
2. Select *r* of them randomly.
3. Possible outcomes = $\frac{n!}{r! * (n-r)!}$

**Bucketing**

1. Start with *n* distinct items.
2. Start with *r* containers.
3. Possible outcomes = $r^n$

### Probability

**Sample space**: all possible outcomes

**Event space**: the outcomes we care about

- Example: sample space is H or T but event space is only H

**Probability**

- $P(E) \: as \: n \: approaches \: 0 = \frac{n(E)}{n} = \frac{Trials \: resulting \: in \: E}{Trials}$

---

### Conditional Probability

- $P(E|F) = \frac{P(EF)}{P(F)} = \frac{P(E \: and \: F)}{P(F)}$

**Distribution**: Set of values & corresponding probabilities

**Probability**: Degree of belief in an outcome

- **Conjoint**: Prob that 2 things are true.
  - Only when independent.

**Bayes Theorem**

- $P(A|B) = \frac{p(A) \: * \: p(B|A)}{p(B)}$
- $Posterior = \frac{Prior \: * \: Likelihood}{Normalizing \: Constant}$
- **Diachronic interpretation**: our prob changes as events play out over time
- Our **suite** of hypoth should be:
  - **Mutually exclusive**: only 1 can be right
  - **Collectively exhaustive**: 1 of them must be right

Thales

1. Draw a semicircle.
2. Create a dot on the semicircle.
3. This always create a right triangle.
